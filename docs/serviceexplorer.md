# Service Explorer

This GUI application looks and works similar as the MicroSoft service explorer. However this application is intended 
to show and configure the service daemons. These services require command line arguments and registry handling to 
function correctly.

Note that there is a feature when adding a service the first time on a computer, that the first login as a service, 
has to be done manually. If you service doesn't start, then go to the Windows Service Manager and change the login
password manually.
